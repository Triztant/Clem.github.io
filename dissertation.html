Foreword

The first algorithm was created in 2012. Google submitted a patent for the “News Feed”, a system that illustrated how Facebook, at the time, aimed to rank “new stories” based on their relevance to individual users (Zuckerberg, Cox and Sanghvi, 2012). As the internet rapidly grew and the amount of uploaded information significantly increased, spanning 2.4 billion users globally, the traditional chronological way most websites organised content proved insufficient for meeting users’ needs. Chronological feeds systematically failed to differentiate the importance of posts, treating trivial updates, such as a post about tea, in the same way as significant events, for example a family member’s wedding (Chayka, 2025). Algorithms, rules or systems designed to rank and prioritise content have become the unseen architects of digital platforms.
Google’s patent introduced a system where “an order is assigned to the items of media content based on their anticipated importance to the user, with the items displayed in the assigned order.” (Zuckerberg, Cox and Sanghvi, 2012)  This quickly became the norm across social media platforms such as Twitter and Blogpost. Algorithms began dictating what users saw, giving companies significant control over their audiences' experience. It has been reported that digital natives, for instance Gen-Z of which 61% use their smartphone 5 or more hours per day (McCoy, 2020), have a large part of their life dictated by algorithms. They shape the stream of information and entertainment consumed. As quality sorting algorithms gained more control over what people see, their guidelines and rules became more important for creators to learn. The concept of ‘quality’ as defined through algorithms has become increasingly important, leading to a shift on platforms such as Instagram and TikTok, where users create content tailored for algorithms rather than for humans.
 
Introduction

This paper will explore how companies and creators strategically navigate and exploit algorithms to maximise their engagement. 

I will first investigate how small creators on platforms, for example Instagram and Airbnb, experience the dual edged nature of algorithms from the opportunity of a global reach to unpredictability. Instagram’s pivot, such as the introduction of ‘Reels,’ can impact millions, leading creators to experience Algorithmic Anxiety (Jhaver et al., 2018). This drives conformity, as seen with creators like PurpleJumble, who adjust their aesthetic for visibility. On the other hand, Etsy shows an alternative use of algorithms to prioritise originality over performance metrics.
 
I will then analyse the Greggs x Primark clothing collaboration which is a good example of utilising algorithmic preferences for engagement with the use of post-irony, absurdity and cultural awareness. This resonates with digital savvy audiences, using shared humour to boost engagements and promote the clothes online. We will see  the role of absurdity and shareability; for example Greggs branded sandals tapping into meme culture (Inglis and BIMM Institute, 2024). Moreover, how Greggs exploits the algorithm by eliciting both positive and negative reactions to boost engagement metrics (Dineva, 2023). This leads me to consider if these strategic marketing decisions are good ethically as well as putting into perspective the rejection of elitist norms in fashion. 

Finally, I will be looking at  Spotify Wrapped, which focuses on strategic design, maximising its success by aligning with the algorithmic rules of varying social platforms. Their different strategies are designed to increase shareability and aim to go viral. An example of this is user-generated content; users are encouraged to share personalised cards, aligning with algorithmic preferences for organic sharing (Chayka, 2025). As well, low friction sharing features such as one-click buttons and personalised visuals, hashtags, and captions boost shareability. I will also be examining visual appeal techniques that use bold colours and animations in exchange for algorithmic favorability (De Vries, Gensler and Leeflang, 2012). Lastly simultaneous global release to dominate feeds and leverage ‘fear of missing out’ and social proof to drive participation and engagement (Sanches, 2023).

As a Graphic designer, social media is at the forefront of my practice. Graphic design and social media are now deeply intertwined and my intimate understanding of these algorithms, stemming from years of managing social media accounts, gives me a deep knowledge of how they work.  

My methodology incorporates a diverse range of sources, including academic research papers, books, social media posts, and primary interviews. I draw from references such as Cotter’s in-depth analysis of how digital influencers adapt their content to instagrams to maintain visibility (Cotter, 2018). As well as Chayka’s  critiques of modern algorithms (Chayka 2025).  Additionally, I will analyse tweets and conduct firsthand interviews with Instagram creators who navigate with the algorithm day to day. This multifaceted approach provides a robust foundation to examine the strategies and tactics employed by companies and creators that use algorithmic systems to their advantage. Through this approach, I aim to explore how algorithms, particularly those governing digital platforms like Instagram, Pinterest and TikTok, are reshaping contemporary graphic design. 


Chapter  1 - Algorithms and Online Platforms 
<p>
This chapter considers the dual-edged nature of algorithms, analysing examples such as Instagram's pivot to Reels, showing how platform shifts can disrupt creators’ livelihoods. Examining the homogenisation of content, I show how creators like “PurpleJumble” alter their aesthetics for algorithms to maintain ‘visibility’. Finally, I discuss the concept of ‘algorithmic anxiety’ revealing the emotional and professional toll of navigating opaque ranking systems. 
Instagram and other social platforms have become important tools for artists and creators.  These platforms serve as direct links between creators, consumers and potential clients, therefore helping secure contracts and maintaining livelihoods. They enable artists to reach broader audiences and engage directly with opportunities such as commissions; almost every design agency maintains an Instagram presence and most artists actively showcase their work on social media, highlighting its integral role in the creative industry (Scolere, 2019). Understanding the positives and negatives that creators face attempting to align with algorithmic trends is vital in the modern digital world.

Adami, Elisabetta and Jewitt (2016 p.1) emphasise that “social media [is] a significant part of contemporary communication.” By connecting creators with audiences in real time, online platforms have reshaped how artistic work gains visibility and recognition. For instance, the power of an online presence is evident in the success of Premftbl - a popular Instagram account with 160,000 followers that posts image-based designs linked to football news. Through primary research, it was revealed that “100%” of his income has come from his online presence amplified by his sports designs, emphasising the importance of an impressionable online presence in securing opportunities for creatives (Armstrong, 2025). However an over reliance, being ignored or not prioritised by an algorithm could be detrimental, encouraging conformity to what the algorithm is likely to prioritise. With such high incentives, as 87% of people who purchase art or graphics use Instagram, it is hard for people to resist these tactics (Powell, 2021).

Instagram is an algorithm-driven platform. This can have a significant impact on creators starting with nothing to then gaining millions in likes. The algorithm dictates whether content will be seen or overlooked, making success contingent on understanding and adapting to its mechanics. As Galloway (2006 p.8) notes “To win means to know the system. And thus, to interpret a game means to interpret its algorithm”. Instagram’s algorithms, though not fully transparent, prioritise metrics such as likes, comments and time spent on posts. When a post receives higher engagement, it is perceived as higher-quality, boosting its visibility. However, the criteria for what is deemed high-quality can shift depending on Instagram’s changing priorities, such as valuing likes over comments. This fluid standard gives the platform immense power over what content thrives. This unpredictability of the algorithm can, and often has, significant negative effects. As Abby Ohlheiser (2020) noted in an MIT Technology Review report, “things on the Internet mean depending on platforms that could change drastically in an instant” (MIT Technology Review, 2020). Such an erratic marketplace can be devastating to small businesses. A clear example of such a shift occurred in mid 2020 when Instagram pivoted heavily toward its new Reels feature.

In the early 2020s, TikTok quickly became a globally used social platform due to its new and engaging short-form video format. Users would continuously scroll down a stream of short videos. This format was a huge success seeing 850 million app downloads in 2020 alone (TikTok Revenue and Usage Statistics, 2024). In response, Instagram launched Reels, a direct competitor that mimicked TikTok’s format. Adam Mosseri, the Head of Instagram, openly acknowledged the platform’s new direction, stating “We’re no longer just a photo-sharing app.” (Mosseri, 2021). This highlights the change in direction as Instagram now prioritises Reel formatted content over original pictures posts. Creators noted a drastic drop in picture posts engagement after the new feature was introduced (Cotter, 2018). Individuals and businesses that relied on the platform for work, or even leisure, were compelled to adapt swiftly, reorganising their entire business strategy in response.

While some argue that Instagram’s shift to video content undermines creators and their livelihoods, it could also be seen as a response to younger user preferences, a growing number of users preferring video content. Due to lower attention spans and ubiquitous smartphones, making quicker, easily digestible video content more popular with Gen-Z and Millennial users. Furthermore 72% of Gen-Z users consume video content daily, favouring it over text or image-based formats (Haenlein et al., 2020). Instagram could just be following consumers and adapting to changing demographics, but could it be at the cost of their current foundational users? 

Homogenisation of Content

Algorithms have become the gatekeepers of culture and content, analysing the effect of prioritising specific types of content while marginalising others. I will discuss how creators and companies exploit these opaque algorithms to optimise engagement and how this can lead to homogenization - arguing that while platforms provide pathways to income, it can place creators in boxes and prioritise conformity (Bishop, 2023).


Figure 1: Valérie Jay (2025) Watercolour Paintings [Instagram screenshot]

Creators have had to adopt strategies to navigate what Cotter describes as the “visibility game” (Cotter, 2018 p.895). This metaphor highlights how creators contend with Instagram’s opaque algorithmic rules to maintain their presence and relevance. The algorithm’s power shapes not only what gains visibility but also how creators approach their work through engagement and interactions. This dynamic can be seen in a number of watercolor artists' accounts on Instagram, which appeared during lockdown, attracting a new audience of young amateur painters looking for creative outlets. What emerged was a highly curated aesthetic: overhead shots of neatly arranged art supplies, in-progress paintings and clean yet messy workspaces. These compositions, which romanticise the creative process, cater to audiences who crave a behind the scenes glimpse into the life of an artist. Compare this to a raw or chaotic studio's instagram who gain far less traction even though the work itself is similar, showcasing the prioritisation of aesthetic content on Instagram (Jongepier, 2025). While this approach is effective for engagement, it often results in homogenisation, as artists mimic what the algorithm rewards. Homogenisation refers to content that starts to converge into similar forms, styles or themes, pastel colours on Instagram for instance (Valdivieso Benavente, 2024). This has the potential to limit what users are exposed to and curbing artist diversity. An example of this is the Instagram watercolourist ‘PurpleJumble’, who posts almost exclusively in this highly curated aesthetic. With over a total of 1,400 daily uploads, she (Valerie Jay) has refined and perfected the colourful scenic paintings using the algorithm to reach audiences effectively. While this strategy sustains her career (the same style has been applied by her book publisher) it shows a broader issue: dependence on the algorithm can prioritise conformity over self-expression. It is evident artists like PurpleJumble feel as though they need to adopt a highly curated persona that's been designed to align with what works on the algorithm. 

For many artists,“Instagram offers an essential pathway to income generation and a sustainable career” as Sophie Bishop from the University of Leeds explains (Bishop, 2023 p.6 ). With over 80% of Instagram users discovering new products through the app, artists who neglect being actively online risk being left behind by those who conform to algorithmic preferences (Newberry, 2025). However, prioritising the algorithm often means neglecting creativity, creating tension between producing high-performing content and work that genuinely reflects the artist’s voice. 

Etsy, an alternative marketplace, offers a less metric-driven approach. Although it uses algorithms, it utilises metrics such as customer reviews, search terms and item descriptions, allowing for better evaluation of high quality content (Chayka, 2025). Instagram, however, rewards metrics such as likes and shares whereas Etsy supports niche creators, emphasising individuality over homogenisation. An example of this is “Vintage football beer mats” seller on Etsy, who designs and produces unique beer mats (TheBeerMatShop, 2023). Catering to a specific audience, their work succeeds despite not aligning with mainstream interests or algorithmic demands, generating a stable income. This highlights Etsy’s ability to prioritise self-expression and experimentation, proving algorithms can support art without homogenising it.

Another effect of a result of ambiguous ranking systems is Algorithmic Anxiety which refers to the stress caused by uncertainty when dealing with opaque algorithms such as on Instagram or Airbnb (Jhaver et al., 2018).  The tension between the user and the algorithms can cause large amounts of emotional labour: “You feel like you get so caught up on it, having to turn up everyday and give this lengthy, emotional speech” (Bishop, 2023 p.7). The constant fear of falling into irrelevance if they don’t adhere to the algorithm’s demands, for instance posting regularly (if not daily), can cause users to experience a significant impact on their well-being. “The threat of invisibility disciplines influencers into normalising their behavior” (Cotter, 2018 p.898) which pushes creators to create more safe content to follow and abide by what the algorithm wants, in turn creating an homogenised environment.

In the research paper titled Algorithmic Anxiety and Coping Strategies of Airbnb Hosts they explain: “Therein lies the paradox of algorithmic transparency: evaluative algorithmic systems need to be deliberately somewhat vague in order to deal with inventive bad actors” (Jhaver et al., 2018 p.9). As algorithms conceal parts of their operations, creators and hosts often feel anxious and compelled to develop strategies to navigate around them, attempting to reclaim a sense of control and agency. This anxiety tends to manifest itself into conformity and result in homogenisation as creators feel forced by anxiety to comply with the algorithm. 

Instagram and Etsy are examples of algorithms created with different focuses in mind and the effect these given metrics have on creators. On Instagram, creators are driven to adopt highly curated aesthetics that conform to the algorithm, often at the cost of artist diversity and self expression (Cotter, 2018). In contrast Etsy demonstrates the potential of an algorithm that prioritises originality through metrics like descriptions and customer reviews. As Gillespie and Microsoft note “[algorithms] are not neutral, impartial tools, they encode the priorities and goals of their designers” (Gillespie and Microsoft, 2013 p.17). This proves the dual edged nature of algorithms as both enablers and hinderers.














Chapter 2 - Case Study: Greggs x Primark collaboration

Social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube have quickly become a major space for marketing and finding new customers. As algorithms increase in sophistication and size, it means that visibility is no longer guaranteed but instead relies on the ability to create content that aligns with these algorithms. This has led to the importance of marketing strategies designed to amplify engagement through humour, relatability and shareability.


Figure 2: Greggs (2023) Promotional Graphic [Marketing]

This analysis examines the strategies used by Greggs in their clothing brand collaboration, focusing on how post-irony, absurdity and an understanding of social media algorithms contributed to the campaign’s viral success. I explore how shareability combines all these ideas into a successful marketing campaign as well as the ethical considerations. Analysing how brands effectively take advantage of algorithms for engagement and ultimately sales.

On August 4th 2022, Greggs and Primark launched a surprise clothing collaboration, achieving outstanding 
success both online and in stores. The marketing agency Drummond Central reported that the campaign generated over 10 million impressions, demonstrating its vast reach and engagement. Despite their seemingly unrelated branding, the collaboration was carefully designed to create excitement, resulting in a 21.4% increase in Greggs’ 
YouGov Buzz Score (Central, 2021).

The Role of Post-Irony in Marketing

The Greggs x Primark collaboration stands out not only for its surprising pairing, but also for its use of post-irony, an approach that combines earnestness and sarcasm. This resonates with audiences who traverse a cynical and detached media landscape (Inglis and BIMM Institute, 2024). Post-irony blurs the distinction between sincerity and irony, creating a blend of humour and authenticity that resonates well with younger generations such as Gen-Z and Millennials, who are more media-savvy and irony-literate (Chayka, 2025). In contrast to the oversaturation of nostalgia and traditional marketing, post-ironic humour appears fresh and contemporary, particularly in online spaces. By combining humour and authenticity, post-irony appeals to the younger audience's desire for material that is both entertaining and meaningful, making it an effective tactic in the algorithmic age.  

Post-irony has increasingly become a strategy used for engaging audiences on algorithmic driven platforms. Greggs x Primark collaboration provides an interesting case study to analyse the use of post-irony and its power to transform a marketing campaign into a viral moment. 

Figure 3: Greggs (2022) Slingback Clogs [Shoe]

The initial humour of post-irony attracts early adopters who share it, resulting in a snowball effect as the algorithm pushes the content to a larger audience. Algorithms, like Instagram’s Explore feed or TikTok For You Page amplify humorous and shareable content disproportionately (Heikkonen, 2024). The Greggs-branded sandals were a standout example of this approach. Their bright blue-and-yellow design, complete with steak-bake inspired cutouts (figure 3), deliberately avoided traditional notions of aesthetic appeal. Despite their intentionally over-the-top look, Greggs marketed them as a high-fashion item. This created a shared inside joke, where the audience’s recognition of the irony enhanced the campaign’s shareability and appeal. This relatability creates a sense of inclusion in an in-group of users who understand the cultural references. The risk of these in-groups is alienating audiences unfamiliar with the humour or cultural references like older generations. “Babe, are you okay? You’ve barely touched your Greggs Slingback Clogs”: (@GreggsOfficial, 2022) was a tweet promoting the sandals created in a popular meme format, increasing the campaign’s cultural relevance and maximising its shareability. This use of absurd humour demonstrated a deeper understanding of how algorithms interact with content, resulting in the sandals becoming a viral talking point. 
This strategy's effectiveness highlights the power of irony, evoking pleasure, and creating a positive attitude toward the object. Research found that people pay more attention to ironic advertisements than to straightforward ones, as they engage the audience’s curiosity and intellect (Win and Raheem, 2024). In this context, the absurdity of the Greggs sandals becomes a key driver of brand engagement and connection. The public's reactions reinforced this strategy. One social media user responded to the sandals with “These are horrendous. I'll take 5 pairs” (Truffle Social, 2020), a comment that perfectly captures the blend of humour and curiosity the campaign intended to create. This form of engagement, whether fun or critical, helped the campaign's overall success by increasing its visibility. This demonstrated Greggs’ strategic understanding of social media algorithms. By designing content that encouraged both positive and negative reactions, the brand maximised engagement. Algorithms on platforms such as Twitter and Instagram favour content that receives high interaction, therefore even nasty comments contributed to visibility. While this strategy undeniably works in getting engagement, it raises concerns regarding the potential encouragement of negative reactions. 
Leveraging Absurdity for Virality & Anti-Elitism

Absurdity, anti-elitism and shareability are three main strategies that Greggs utilise to disrupt the traditional fashion market by embracing self-aware humour and challenging elitist conventions defended by brands such as Balenciaga. Exploring the shareability of the Greggs x Primark merchandise striking cultural resonance that is prioritised by algorithms to achieve high engagement and high sales. Paul Taylor, Chief Creative Officer at BrandOpus, highlighted the deeper cultural significance of wearing Greggs-branded clothing. He described it as a rejection of elitism in food and fashion, symbolising a playful challenge to snobbery. By turning a bakery’s logo into a fashion statement, consumers embraced the humour and absurdity of the collaboration. This approach not only resonated with audiences but also exemplified how post-irony can be used to change tradition while fostering engagement. This directly translated to sales as the merchandise sold out almost instantly (Greggs, 2023). Greggs’ use of humour and relatability stands out when we compare it to another example of absurd post-ironic marketing in fashion: Balenciaga’s 2023 release of “Super Destroyed Wide-Leg Jeans”. While Balenciaga’s reliance on shock value might generate short-term buzz, such tactics risk alienating audiences and creating a polarising brand image. On the other hand, Greggs’ use of  humour appealed to a more mainstream audience. Its approach leaned into self-aware humour. This accessibility made the campaign resonate with a wider demographic. 

As Matt Poile Foresight Editor at a strategic consultancy, noted: “These are items that are made to be photographed and posted on social media, a bit like wearing a meme” (cited in Bramley, 2022). This focus on creating shareable, visually striking content, paired with post-ironic marketing, led to high engagement online, such as on Tiktok and Instagram, resulting in sales.

Greggs’ strategy shows how brands can utilise post-irony to challenge conventional marketing norms. The Greggs x Primark collaboration demonstrated the potential of cultural relevance and commercial success. As algorithms continue to improve and evolve, brands such as Greggs will need to adapt their strategies to stay relevant by continuing to find unconventional ways to take advantage of social media algorithms. The success of the Greggs x Primark campaign highlights the importance of humour, absurdity and cultural awareness. Overall, this case study reveals the complexities and detail it takes to craft a successful marketing campaign.




























Chapter 3 - Spotify Wrapped

Each year, in late November, Spotify releases their marketing campaign ‘Spotify Wrapped’. It takes over the landing screen of all Spotify app accounts, inviting them to ‘swipe’ through a breakdown of their personalised listening habits of the past year (Annabell and Rasmussen, 2024). Through a visually vibrant designed format, users can quickly swipe through fast paced videos and animations similar to other social media “stories” (Gartner, 2023). 

Spotify is an example of professionals employing various strategies to design Spotify Wrapped. They capitalise on algorithmic preferences, such as user-generated content, through encouraging users to post their personalised cards on other platforms. Spotify also places significant focus on shareability by incorporating one-click share options, preformatted visuals and pre-made hashtags. In addition to zero friction shareability, the use of visual appeal such as vivid colours, animations and dynamic charts optimises engagement. Finally, the simultaneous release of Wrapped generates a surge of posts across several social feeds, creating a shared cultural moment and exploits the fear of missing out (FOMO) and social proof. The close examination of these four strategies will explain why and how they effectively manipulate platform algorithms to amplify engagement and visibility.

Strategy 1 - User Generated Content

User generated content (USG) functions as the foundation of Spotify Wrapped, with other strategies designed to amplify its effectiveness. Spotify takes advantage of how online algorithms such as Instagram prioritise USG over advertisements as it is classed as higher quality by the algorithm. In comparison to slick corporate advertising, USG is often viewed as real and trustworthy which normally drives better engagement (Chayka 2025). By encouraging users to share their Spotify Wrapped, they not only create organic promotion, which is proven to be more valuable than non-organic, but also align with the algorithm’s preferences resulting in more engagement and exposure (Cunningham, 2024).

Strategy 2 - Built for Sharing

Shareability is one of the most important metrics on social media platforms and can make or break a marketing campaign like Spotify's. When designing the “Spotify Wrapped”, maximising shareability was clearly the main focus of the music streaming provider..


Figure 4: CNET (2023) Share Option [Spotify screenshot]

Spotify makes shareability as low friction as possible. An example of this is by making the visual format fit perfectly into Instagram stories, TikTok videos or X posts with 9:16 ratio to facilitate easy sharing (Spotify, 2024). A second example is how Spotify has designed a one-click sharing option for its Wrapped campaign (figure 4). At the bottom of the screen, Spotify has implemented a single, prominently labeled ‘Share this story’ button. By simplifying the sharing process to one step, Spotify reduces friction for users sharing their results. Thirdly, Spotify offers a range of designed options to increase the likelihood of satisfying everyone, and therefore increasing its chances of it being shared on other social platforms like Instagram and Tiktok. Lastly, pre-added captions and hashtags boost discoverability; hashtags interact with the algorithms, resulting in platforms recognising them as popular, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem of trending content. 

This emphasis on shareability not only attracts new users who wish to participate in the trend but also strengthens user retention by creating a sense of anticipation and belonging to an annual cultural event (which will be addressed in a later section). However, while highly effective, these strategies may alienate users who prefer less public-facing features raising questions about the inclusivity and accessibility of algorithm-driven design. By centering the design around sharing, such as the prominently displayed ‘Share’ button, Spotify may unintentionally exclude or irritate users who feel uncomfortable broadcasting personal data, even if it is as seemingly benign as their music habits (Annabell and Rasmussen, 2024).

By simplifying the process of sharing Spotify increases the likelihood of people sharing taking advantage of metrics like reposts. The design decisions clearly reflect a deliberate effort to design for ease of sharing and as a result, they successfully align with the algorithm for engagement. This streamlined approach to sharing also encourages reposts but also a collective cultural moment, as explored in the following section.



Strategy 3 - Visual Appeal for Algorithmic Favorability 

Spotify Wrapped success on social media platforms can be attributed in part to its deliberate use of visually dynamic design elements. It strategically uses bright unconventional colours and animations designed for online platforms to maximise shareability and standing out. I evaluate the risk of designing algorithms rather than the taste of humans. 


Figure 5: License Global (2023) Wrapped Cards [Spotify screenshot]

These vivid colours and moving animations are optimised for social media, evoking emotion and appealing to short attention spans fostered by online platforms. Research suggests that vividness and motion that is appealing to the eye, play a significant role in determining a post’s performance online (de Vries, Gensler & Leeflang, 2012). Wrapped uses unconventional colour combinations (Figure 5), of neon green, bright yellow and bright pink as a colour palette. The unconventional chromatic clash helps it stand out in crowded feeds and makes it more likely to grab users attention, stopping them from scrolling. This pattern interruption is crucial, as algorithms favour content that maximises ‘time spent’ metrics, reflecting user attention and engagement (de Vries, Gensler & Leeflang, 2012).

Spotify Wrapped engages users with its bold color palette yet also through playful design elements such as the “burger top genre card.” This card incorporates vivid gradients and over 20 colors into features like “burger buns,” which represent different chart sections. Fun additions, such as lettuce, tomato, and cheese, give the design a humorous feel that users naturally gravitate toward. This creative approach made it the most shared card of the year (Spotify, 2023). The cards also incorporate animated elements such as rainbows and moving shapes that disrupt static layouts improving visual hierarchy. These features align with the priorities of platforms like TikTok and Instagram, which favour visually stimulating and shareable content, contributing to Wrapped’s high engagement levels (Chayka, 2025).

Even if Spotify wrapped design intentions are most likely algorithmic, Wrapped demonstrates the power of design in capturing users attention and driving engagement offering insight into the relationship between algorithms, user and graphic design.

Strategy 4 - Collective Cultural moment

Spotify designs its Wrapped campaign to tap into psychological behaviours such as FOMO and social proof to further amplify its reach and impact. This is executed using strategies including simultaneous release and fostering a collective cultural moment. Finding the balance between features that play into the algorithmic rules and creativity.

The last strategy in which Spotify optimises ‘Wrapped’ to align with algorithms is by attempting to make it into an online collective cultural moment. Wrapped is launched every year for everyone simultaneously at the same time, in an attempt to create a shared collective experience.

Releasing ‘Wrapped’ on the same day increases its likelihood of dominating the timeline for days. “[Wrapped] is posted everywhere” (Gartner, 2023). This helps form a trend and makes Wrapped more impactful. It taps into a sense of belonging as people share personalised music stats and bond over similar tastes. When users see multiple wrapped posts on their feeds they are more likely to engage or even post their own as an attempt to join the collective moment, which in turn exposes the trend to more new people who might be likely to do it themselves, starting a snowball effect. Spotify’s head of marketing, June Sauvaget, told Forbes that Wrapped “creates this FOMO effect that happens and that inherently entices new users to consider Spotify” (Swant, 2019). The goal was to create a desire to join this shared collective cultural moment resulting in users downloading or returning to Spotify.  FOMO works in tandem with social proof, as seeing others post Wrapped validates its importance, driving more people to download Spotify or post themselves. This use of trends isn’t new: many companies like Nike and Netflix use the same strategies. For example when Netflix releases an entire TV series simultaneously on the same day, the same effects and results can be seen (Sharma, 2016). This collective moment favours algorithms as they create trending content and keep users engaged on the platform for longer, ultimately increasing ad revenue for the platform. This worked with 60 million people sharing their Spotify Wrapped on social media almost half of the people who were able to (De Guzman, 2023). It is important to consider that, while successful for Spotify, this creation of FOMO echoes Karl Marx’s discussion on capitalism thriving on creating artificial needs as seen the desire to share music cards with strangers online as Spotify creates a campaign, which could be seen as a described ‘commodity’ (Marx, 1996).

Spotify successfully creates a collective cultural moment by releasing the marketing campaign on a platform that encourages sharing, resulting in an increased amount of engagement and virality. 

The bombardment of Wrapped cards fosters envy and a FOMO for those who don’t have access. These metrics are crucial for Spotify as they directly influence revenue, driving the need to exploit the algorithm with strategies such as FOMO and by creating shared cultural moments. For designers and creators, this shows how important it is to strike a balance between exploiting human behaviour and the algorithm for engagement with creating meaningful ethical experiences for the user. How companies can design the FOMO and social proof with cultural collectivity to create a powerful campaign that does more than visually appeal to users but also compel them to join. 

In Conclusion Spotify Wrapped successfully uses algorithmic principles and shortcomings to drive engagement. They employ 4 main strategies: (1) incentivising everyday users to generate posts and interact with Wrapped increasing engagement and virality; (2) designing and formatting: Wrapped is built to be easily shared and reposted, reducing the friction between sharing on other platforms’ designed element and cards formatted for Instagram stories; (3) designing Wrapped with dynamic charts and bold colours to be visually vibrant and striking, ultimately optimised for social media; (4) creating a collective cultural moment each year to amplify the trend and maximise the sharing, taking advantage of predictable human behaviour. Spotify manages to maximise the amount of posts created during a short period and, as a result, engagement that fuels subscriptions and revenue. Together, these four strategies make Spotify Wrapped exceptionally algorithm optimised, with every design choice clearly intended to maximise the distance it will travel online with the help of algorithmic driven platforms.   




Conclusion

Today, design and social media are intrinsically intertwined by the algorithms that drive them. More than ever, it’s important to be aware how companies and creators strategically exploit or comply with algorithms to gain engagement and how algorithms are shaping contemporary graphic design. 
Through three separate case studies, from everyday creators attempting to take advantage of the algorithm to earn a livelihood online (Instagram and TikTok) to professional designers working for larger corporations (Greggs and Spotify) meticulously designing every feature, one can see that all creators, regardless of scale or expertise, must follow the same algorithmic rules to achieve visibility and success. However, the strategies they employ to navigate these rules vary significantly.
This paper has examined the rise of homogenisation on platforms including Instagram as a result of a strict metric based algorithm that prioritises universally appealing styles, patterns and colours. A system that ultimately rewards conformity. Algorithms, in essence, force creators to conform, creating a paradox: they must be unique enough to stand out but also follow the rules to remain visible. The homogenisation of content observed in the case of “PurpleJumble” demonstrated how algorithms drive homogenisation, often at the expense of creative diversity.

The shift to Reels on Instagram is another example of the challenges faced by creators to adapt to algorithmic changes, leading for some to “algorithmic anxiety”. For non-designers relying on platforms such as Airbnb or Etsy, this anxiety is compounded by the psychological toll of feeling powerless when their efforts fail to generate income. The pressure to conform and the uncertainty of algorithmic systems highlight the human cost of design’s dependence on these platforms.
The case studies of Greggs x Primark and Spotify Wrapped illustrate innovative approaches to engaging with algorithms. On the one hand, Greggs chooses to utilise absurdity, post-irony and cultural resonance to create a shareable clothing campaign to great success. However, this success has its limitations, as the novelty of such strategies may be difficult to replicate without diminishing returns. On the other hand, Spotify Wrapped prefers to use user-generated content (UGC), visually optimised designs, shareability and collective cultural moments to dominate feeds and create an annual viral trend. These two examples reveal how strategies can harness algorithms for viral success but at the risk of prioritising design for the algorithm rather than for the human users who interact with these campaigns. 

The focus on algorithms also highlights the influence of financial and commercial priorities. Platforms incentivise safe designs that cater to mass appeal, leaving little room for risk-taking or bold, innovative creativity. This tension between experimentation and conformity is a following theme throughout this study. 

Despite these challenges, algorithms do have benefits such as being able to filter and manage the 95 million posts made each day; allowing access to global audiences, enabling small creators to reach users far beyond what would’ve been possible before. Among all these platforms, one (Etsy) provides alternative models, prioritising originality and niche appeal over homogenised trends.

Companies and creators use a variety of strategies that capitalise on social media algorithms. From Greggs’ use of post-irony and cultural humour to Spotify's professional application of shareable content, and even small creators’ conformity, the extent to which these strategies are efficacious is evident. Yet, they can involve trade-offs including  homogenisation, ethical concerns, and anxiety around the target of the design. As algorithms continue to shape our digital landscape, it is crucial for designers to work towards a future online space where algorithms are built with room for creativity and experimentation as well as financial engagement.  

Ultimately, algorithms are now central to the world of design, dictate aesthetic trends, engagement strategies, and prioritised content. While they enable visibility and offer creators tools to achieve success, their homogenising influence and the mental toll they impose present significant challenges for the future of graphic design.`;
